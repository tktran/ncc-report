I should actually set some goals for the paper:

-for each concept covered in the multiprocessor book, link it back to MySQL
-should it be source code or administrative? it should be administrative first, then explaining briefly (this is accomplished by a _DATA STRUCTURE_ ... blah blah)
- should i write exercises? No - it's not a textbook, it's a freaking REPORT

HERE'S MY FREAKING GOAL:
DON'T BE ORIGINAL AT THE BEGINNING. JUST LINK CONCEPTS VERBATIM.
DON'T WRITE ANY ENGLISH YET. JUST IDENTIFY THE FREAKING RELATED CONCEPTS.

========== APRIL 10 OUTLINE ==========
1.1 SHARED OBJECTS AND SYNCHRONIZATION
	- heart of the problem is the prime number identification is harder than we thought
		when there's more than one thread
	- databases: ACID is easy with only one user; but a lot harder with multiplication:
		then we have to use serialization parameters
1.2 A FABLE
	- We now present a sequence of fables, illustrating some of the basic problems.
	- databases: we now present a series of concurrent database transactions that would
		mess up an otherwise consistent table
	- First fable: mutual exclusion
		-Databases: mutual exclusion in a db! simple!
1.3 THE PRODUCER-CONSUMER PROBLEM
	- Alice and Bob fable on producer-consumer
	- Alice and Bob fable on serialization? weird situations with timing
1.4 THE READERS-WRITERS PROBLEM
	- Readers-writers in a database
1.5 THE HARSH REALITIES OF PARALLELIZATION
	- Amdahl's Law
	- Performance metrics for databases
1.6 PARALLEL PROGRAMMING
	- "The goal of this text is to expose the reader to core ideas behind modern 
		coordination paradigms and concurrent data structures"
	- "The goal of this report is to apply multiprocessor principles to databases, except
		now the CPUs are users of the database. Also, we're using the exact same
		terminology and telling you where it lies in MySQL
